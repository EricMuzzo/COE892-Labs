# Lab 4 - Distributed Cloud Computing

The objective of this lab is to build a distributed rover application featuring an API and a client frontend.
The two applications have their own READMEs that guide installation. I will use this note to share some comments
about my lab

## Some Notes and Comments About My Lab For Future Students
- If you are looking at this as a reference for your own lab, please do not take the UI as a reference
    - It is a disaster
    - I barely know what I did
    - It half works...but it is very inefficient and poorly written
- On the bright side, the API was done much better
    - Everything on the backend works, even if it doesn't on the front-end
- If you are looking for a well written report, I'm not the person to get it from
    - I don't see the value in filling up reports with information copied from the lab manuals
    - I don't fill in my reports with every little step I took. Most of it can be google and is common knowledge
    - I put 100% of my time into actually building something properly, my report is more or less hacked together

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Happy to talk about it.
